This small Sudanese Restaurant near Boxhagener Platz offers quite a few vegan options, e. g. falafel and Tofu Madagascar Sandwich&quot;. The Fohl, Vegan and Bamiya platters, served with a great peanut sauce, combine a variety of tastes and are really delicious.
<br/><br/>Nil offers great food and great value for money. Vegan dishes are clearly marked on the menu. The non vegan dishes are a drawback of course. The staff is, however, well-informed and happy to help.

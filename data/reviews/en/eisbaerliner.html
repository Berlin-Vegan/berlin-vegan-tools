This ice cream parlour buys its ice cream from Tanne B, which was founded in 2004 and whose ice cream is home made. As a result Eisb√§rliner offers nice vegan soya ice cream and sorbet (with a high percentage of fruits) which is fresh and valuable as well as free of colorants, flavor enhancer and stabilizer. 
<br/><br/>There are yummy sorts like lime, soya vanilla, soya chocolate and particularly soya pistachio with a vegan wafer.

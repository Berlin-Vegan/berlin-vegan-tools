Opened in 2002, Smart Deli is a small but noteworthy non vegetarian deli just a few metres from Boxhagener Platz. Several dishes are marked as vegan on the menu and the staff is usually well-informed.
<br/><br/>The vegetarian sushi rolls/Maki are marked as vegan &amp;egg on the menu. Nearly all vegetarian options are suitable for vegans excluding, of course, the omelette sushi rolls (egg).
<br/><br/>We recommend the sushi, tofu Teriyaki with rice, alga salad or miso soup. The prices are in the low range. Smart Deli also sells Asian foodstuffs.
<br/><br/>Every Saturday there is an all-you-can-eat menu, the vegetarian variant of which is 12.50 and suitable for vegans as it does not include omelette Maki.

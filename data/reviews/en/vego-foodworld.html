After the Yellow Sunshine in Kreuzberg as well as the Yoyo Foodworld in Friedrichhain have offered vegan burgers and other vegan fast food, Prenzlauer Berg is now happy to have its own completely vegan fast food restaurant.
<br/><br/>Except for two new items (a nice Vego pizza and a Vego burger) the menu is the same as in the Yoyo: a large variety of burgers, schnitzels, curry sausages, six different pizzas and several wraps. It is tasty and it is easy to choose from the menu for those who know it from the Yoyo. 
<br/><br/>The Vego would like to become a meeting place for vegans as well as for people from Prenzlauer Berg or the rest of Berlin who are interested in getting to know vegan foodÂ—which is one of the reasons why from time to time there are little concerts and the like to accompany nice meals or parties. 
<br/><br/>It is worth while for all fast food fans to drop by at the Vego, for nobody will be disappointed or go home hungry.

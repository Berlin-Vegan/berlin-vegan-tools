In 2004, Berlin's first certified organic café opened near the S-Bahn station Lichterfelde Ost. The café is fully vegetarian provided that you are willing to overlook that they sell dead fish in the form of salmon tart once every four weeks.
<br/><br/>Theres plenty for vegans, too: There is a soy milk option for the coffee specialities, unfortunately at an extra charge. They usually offer two vegan cakes (pear-walnut and coco- tangerine) and in the summertime, the five vegan flavours of ice cream (soy-coconut, strawberry, lemon, buckthorn berry, fruits of forest) will satisfy not just a vegans sweet tooth. The vegan options for savoury dishes are: salad with homemade Italian dressing, tomato soup and red lentil soup. They serve a great vegan breakfast as well. The delicious organic spelt rolls and bread can be enjoyed with vegan soy margarine or cold fake meats, for instance.
<br/><br/>Having room for just about ten people, the café is relatively small, but in warm weather you can sit outside as well. Inside, there is a play corner for children. The toilet is wheelchair accessible, which constitutes a notable exception among the restaurants listed here. Smoking is strictly prohibited at Café Rosenduft, even outside.

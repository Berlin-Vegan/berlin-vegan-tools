The Naveena Path, close to the underground station &nbsp;Leopoldplatz, offers Tamil, Southern Indian food and set high standards for themselves with their motto: Food art.  The inside with ist dark wood and orange walls decorated in the Southern Indian style rather makes the impression of an unfortunate multicultural merger, but the food is excellent.The true art of the restaurant however seems to consist in their ability to serve a vegan version of every dish (which also contain meat, unfortunately) upon request  which means a choice of about 100 tasty delicacies.&nbsp; On the menu 21 dishes are currently declared vegan.  The prices for the dishes are average. Soups cost between 2 and 2.50, main courses between 4 and 7.50, dishes for two people range from 21 to 24. Additionally, school children and students can choose from a special menu one-plate dishes for 4.50. From 2011 a separate menu will present all the purely vegan dishes.   The restaurant is certainly worth visiting, with 35 seats inside and 12 outside it provides the oportunity to go out with numerous friends, e.g. to have a party for which the restaurant would prepare a vegan buffet. By the way, if numerous customers request vegan food, the restaurant owners can well imagine to serve exclusively vegan dishes.

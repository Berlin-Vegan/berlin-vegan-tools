La Mano Verde is a purely vegan gourmet restaurant. Accordingly, the prices are somewhat higher. 
<br/><br/>Go on a fascinating culinary expedition along the exciting menu in a cosy atmosphere. Even long-time vegans are amazed all over again by these interesting compositions. As a speciality, a number of the dishes are served as raw vegetarian food. 
<br/><br/>In 2009 La Mano Verde received PETAs Proggy Award granted to the best vegan restaurant.

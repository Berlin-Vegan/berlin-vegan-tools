Vanille &amp; Co. is a nice café not far from the Kurfürstendamm, offering home-made ice cream and cakes. What's particularly striking about it are the unusual and imaginative ice cream compositions such as apple/rosemary or tomato/basil.
<br/><br/>For 80 Cents per scoop, one can always get five to twelve (!) tasty and fresh types of fruit sorbet; which are indicated as vegan and milk-free directly at the counter. They plan to include soy ice cream and to offer vegan cakes and tarts more regularly. Already you can order whole vegan cakes.
<br/><br/>Whats nice is that you can have a vegan breakfast and vegan biscuits as well.
<br/><br/>An apple/marzipan cake or an apple/soy cream cake costs 30.80 each (incl. a 5&nbsp;% discount for a whole cake). Alternatively, you can also order a &quot;Torta Duchessa&quot; with marsala cream on a hazelnut case coated with chocolate (33.00). The order needs to be placed 2 days in advance.
<br/><br/>The sorbets (500&nbsp;ml packages) currently on offer include mango, cupuacu, nectarine, grapefruit, white peach and strawberry lemonade. So, this café is always worth a visit!

The organic bakery Kuchenmafia is a bright and friendly corner café  located in the Neukölln district which opened only in June 2009. Here,  three vegan types of cake are on offer every day; additionally there is a  varying range of vegan cakes.
<br/><br/>The cakes permanently on the menu are &quot;Linzer Torte&quot;, covered apple  cake and a super-yummy chocolate tart. Unlike the vegan breakfast you  can have as well, the vegan cakes are declared as such. So, when it  comes to the breakfast, you'd better ask explicitly for the vegan variant.
<br/><br/>Allergy sufferers will be pleased to hear that soon they will be able  to buy gluten-free biscuits at this café. The rest of the menu is  exclusively organic-vegetarian. The drinks on offer include tea, coffee,  &quot;Bionade&quot; lemonade, etc., and you can have your coffee with soy milk.
<br/><br/>Theres an extra playroom for children which, unfortunately, is also  the transit room to the lavatories. Nevertheless, it is a very nice  room, with a large table for the larger children and a smaller one for  the younger ones as well as a miniature shop, a rocking horse, etc.  There is also a changing table.
<br/><br/>The toilets are not wheelchair-accessible, and handicapped people may  need assistance with the low step at the entrance. On inquiry, we were  informed that the owners are considering installing a ramp.
<br/><br/>All in all, one can only recommend this café and its tasty food.

The Viasko is located near Fraenkeluferwhere Kreuzberg meets Neukölln. After leaving La Mano Verde Steffen Weigel has offered completely vegan food here since June 2010. 
<br/><br/>They have kept part of the former Irish Pubs charm and integrated it into the nice decoration of the restaurant. The Viasko is a restaurant, a beer garden and a bar all in one, and in its library you can borrow and exchange books on mutual trust.
<br/><br/>On Sundays a brunch buffet is served. The menu changes every week and is composed of regional, seasonal and fresh ingredients.

A nice little vegan organic café was opened in June 2010: York52. The contains fair trade coffee and tea along with tasty cakes, wafers and salty snacks like bagels, rolls, antipasti and salads. Additionally, every day a different cooked dish is served at lunch time. 
<br/><br/>For the very young vegans there is a childrens play area. 
<br/><br/>Every Monday a co-working brunch takes place to get to know people, to network and to plan projects. 
<br/><br/>You will find further information on the café and the events as well as the answer to the question what is a co-working space? at Yorck52.de.

This very small restaurant offers three varieties of organic tofu hot dogs and 2-3 different vegan soups every day. The vegan options are marked. Unfortunately, they sell meat dishes as well, so you will have to explicitly request a vegan option to make sure they wont serve you meat.
<br/><br/>Three of the hot dog options are hot or very hot. As far as the soups are concerned we recommend the red lentil-coco soup, which is on the menu almost daily. The prices are very low (2 for a hot dog and 2.50 for a soup).

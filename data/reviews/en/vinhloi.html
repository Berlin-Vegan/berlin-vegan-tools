Vinh Loi is a well known chain of Asian supermarkets in Berlin with a great range of products for vegans: bamboo sprouts, coconut milks, asian vegetables, tofu (silk-tofu, smoked tofu, backed tofu), sushi, rices, lentils, spices, all kind of Asian sauces and pastes and noodles, snacks, and anything Asian really!

<br/><br/>We really recommend the vegan mini-springrolls and the tasty fish&meat substitutes. Their frozen food, too, has a lot to offer for vegans:  tofu ready-made products, tofu filo pastry, soy chicken substitutes.

Cup cakes are yummy muffins with a cream topping and these are now available in Berlin, too. In BerlinÂ’s first cup cake shop, which opened in 2007, vegetarian and vegan cup cakes are sold for 2.50 EUR per piece. Additionally, you can order various ice creams. 
<br/><br/>For those who want to have a drink, there are, additionally to the usual drinks (Bionade, beer, etc.) warm soya milk drinks (milk coffee and exotic teas with soya milk). 
<br/><br/>In the menu all vegan products are marked (cup cakes, sandwiches, etc.) For instance there are cupcakes with lemon cream, vanilla cream, chocolate cream or peanut cream. There are 12 seats in the restaurant, and in summer one can also sit outside. 
<br/><br/>The only negative remark is that they serve a piece of non-vegan chocolate/non-vegan coffee bean (contains shellac) even with vegan drinks.

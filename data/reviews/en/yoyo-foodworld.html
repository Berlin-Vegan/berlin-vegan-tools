The Yoyo was opened on 8. June 2008. It is a purely vegan and smokefree, organic fast food restaurant which does not only serve nice burgers with French fries but also pizzas, south German cheese spaetzle, gyros, salads and wraps. As desert, there is a range of cakes, e.g. Russian chocolate cheese cake or chocolate cream cake, both very yummy. Next to various coffee specialties there are organic beer, bionade, soya milk shakes and lassi. 
<br/><br/>In Summer you can sit outside. Dogs are welcome. The prices are moderate and the portions large, so that one goes home satisfied. The staff is nice and they are at least vegetarians which ensures competent advice. 
<br/><br/>Yoyo Foodworld received PETAs Proggy Award as the best vegan snack bar.

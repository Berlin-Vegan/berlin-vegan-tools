Manna is a vegetarian café/restaurant in the Prenzlauer Berg district offering a daily changing menu of the day (as indicated on the information boards). It also has vegan meals on offer (these are internationally oriented: curry, pasta, lentil stew, and many more) as well as meals which can be adapted for vegans (e.g. the daily salad and the &quot;veggie burgers&quot;).
<br/><br/>Mannas focus is on the seasonal vegetable cuisine. The ingredients are regional and mostly organic, and the prices are in the medium range. The portions are large and the waiters very friendly.
<br/><br/>The home-made pastries on offer daily always include a vegan option (the plum scones are really great).

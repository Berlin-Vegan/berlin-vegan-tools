Rootz opened in March 2010 and is a rather unusually furnished restaurant with a small outside terrace. It is located directly opposite the U1 underground station Schlesisches Tor in the heart of the Kreuzberg district; this is one reason why its owners like to call it THE &quot;veggie of the Kietz&quot;. Rootz is a fully vegetarian restaurant and offers quite a selection of vegan dishes (10 out of 26 meals).
<br/><br/>Its name is derived from the English word roots. But roots are more than just carrots&nbsp; Rootz logo is a turnip&nbsp; therefore, unlike normal French fries, the ones offered here are made of parsnips, sweet potatoes, carrots and parsley roots. They are seasoned with a slightly hot cajun spice&nbsp; the overall taste is sweetish and so far quite unknown to us. Of course, you can have normal French fries, too. Other vegan dishes include the Gartenburger (&quot;garden burger&quot;), the avocado bagel, the &quot;Körriewurscht&quot; (curry sausage) and, sometimes, the daily meal.
<br/><br/>Part of the dishes is organic, but being organic is not one of the restaurants main principles. The prices are on the average level. And, of course, you can have your coffee &amp; co with soy milk.
<br/><br/>All in all you can say that Rootz enlarges Berlin's range of vegetarian/vegan restaurants by an interesting new component and will very likely find its niche.

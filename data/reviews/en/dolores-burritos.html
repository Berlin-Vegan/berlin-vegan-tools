This small restaurant is situated near Alexanderplatz (square) at Rosa-Luxemburg Straße 7. The dishes are as wild and loud as the music and the unconventional décor. The restaurant specializes in Burritos and, thanks to the growing trend towards the vegan diet, offers a vegan option as well. The vegan options are clearly marked.
<br/><br/>The staff told us that they are very careful to use only &quot;vegan&quot; kitchen appliances and cutlery (e. g. deep fryers and knives) when preparing vegan dishes. If you would like, you can make sure of this yourself as patrons can see the kitchen area and watch the staff prepare the food.
<br/><br/>The staff is friendly, constantly scurries around and seems to have everything under control even though the restaurant occasionally has an air of chaos to it.
<br/><br/>The reasonable prices allow for a second burrito in case youre famished. The homemade lemonades are another speciality and if you have a sweet tooth, you will be happy to know that Dolores also offers vegan cakes from Freckles.

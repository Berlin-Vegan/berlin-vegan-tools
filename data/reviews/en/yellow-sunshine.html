Opened in 2004, the Yellow Sunshine was Germany's  first vegetarian organic fast food restaurant. They offer a wide variety  of burgers (e. g. fake fish, fake chicken, tofu, seitan), salads,  soups, gyro, fresh fries, soy milk shakes, and coffee specialities. 
<br/><br/>Over 50% of the dishes are vegan and clearly marked on the menu. The prices are reasonable considering that the food is organic.

International Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics has 16 shops in Germany, four of which are located in Berlin.

<br/><br/>Most of their products are vegan, and usually it is clearly stated on the packaging; however, if you are not sure about a product, the kind and competent shop assistants are always ready to assist you.
<br/><br/>And all their products are cruelty free, innovative and made with natural ingredients and scents: from their famous "baths bombs" to shampoos, body lotions and soaps.

<br/><br/>Lush is also well known for its involvement in Animal Rights activities. Therefore we always recomment Lush instead of the Body Shop, which is owned by L'Or√©al.

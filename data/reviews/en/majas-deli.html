When it was opened, Majas Deli was the first completely vegan bistro in Berlin. It is owned by two nice vegan women who prepare all the food themselves with fresh ingedients. 
<br/><br/>They serve lasagne, gratins, soups, cakes, cookies, muffins, etc. The prices are OK. The range of dishes satisfies even demanding vegans. Even not yet vegans can experience that the cakes can easily match the taste of conventional cakes. All products also to take away.

Since the beginning of October 2009 there has been a further, completely vegan café in Berlin: the cosy café Vux in Neukölln that serves dishes inspired from Brazil. Not only the cafés decoration is impressive, so are the menu and the glass case presenting the cakes and fancy cakes. Even not yet vegans can experience that the cakes can easily match the taste of conventional cakes.&nbsp;
<br/><br/>Everything is prepared and baked freshly every day. The idea is pretty original: vegan dishes inspired from Brazilian cuisine. We have tried the very tasty bagel sandwiches: very much to be recommended with toasted tofu and fresh peanut sauce or with grilled seitan and a special lime sauce. Different soups and salads are served every day, and they offer a great variety of drinks. 
<br/><br/>Here is a list of the special dishes that are prepared freshly every day:
<br/><br/>home-made cookies, fancy cakes, cup cakes or waffers with hot fruits and soya cream
<br/><br/>fine fair trade coffee and tea specialities or hot chocolate with a pinch of chili and soya or rice milk
<br/><br/>tropical smoothies made of açai berries, passion fruits, coconuts, mangos, guavas or cashew fruits
<br/><br/>As well as smaller dishes and snacks:
<br/><br/>every day different soups and salads or bagels with fresh sprouts, marinaded tofu sate, seitan-limão, guava jelly and vegan cheese, hummus or sausage with caramelized oignons. 
<br/><br/>The portions are large and made of many fresh ingredients, the prices are moderate and the waiter/waitress is very friendly.

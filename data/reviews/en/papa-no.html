Papa Nô is a small Berlin-based Japanese restaurant chain with four restaurants&nbsp; situated in the districts of Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg and Lichtenberg.
<br/><br/>The vegan cucumber, prune, avocado or horse reddish sushi and, above all, the sate or tofu skewers with peanut sauce make the nicely decorated restaurants worth a visit. Vegan fake duck breast with red curry-coco sauce, fresh vegetables Thai basil and rice (hot) is also on the menu. If you are not too hungry the Miso-Wan soup or the vegan burger are just right.
<br/><br/>All (vegetarian) sushi rolls should be suitable for vegans as the regular wraps are made of edible seaweed and the colourful ones are made of soy protein. At least that is what we were told upon request.
<br/><br/>The prices are rather low, ranging from 2.50 for soup or sushi and 3-3.50 for burgers or skewers to 7 for the fake duck breast. If your order is worth at least 10, you can also order in by telephone or via their website.
<br/><br/>Note: Unfortunately, only the vegan burger is marked as such on the menu; however we were told upon request that all vegetarian dishes are suitable for vegans as well.

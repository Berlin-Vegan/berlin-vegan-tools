In its quiet and non-smoking atmosphere, Samadhi offers a great variety of tasty specialties from Viet Nam and Thailand. Theres quite a large selection of both starters and main courses on the menu, encouraging you to experiment. But for a few, all meals are vegan, although not explicitly declared as such. If you are uncertain, you can always rely upon the friendly and competent waiters to give you the necessary information.
<br/><br/>The prices for the main courses are rather on the high side (ranging from 9.50 to 16.00). However, the meals on the special lunch menu (served from 12:00&nbsp;a.m. to 03:00&nbsp;p.m.) include some costing just 7.50.
